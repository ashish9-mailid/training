1.	inner classes and nested classes 
2.	Exception Handling 
3.	Equals() and HashCode()
4.      Generic class /interface
5 .	Collection Introduction

1. Regular (nonstatic ) nested class can be private,protected,default or public.
2. Static members cannot be created inside.

3. Static inner class can have any access specifier.
4. Can have both static and nonstatic members

2. is a child class or implementation of an interface

	1. implement MyComparator for 2 Book Objects.

		Book has -- (isbn String , title String, price double, stock long)
	that returns a +ve , -Ve or 0. after comparing the price.


Exceptions : try catch throws finally throw

	Collections:

	ArrayList -- dynamic -- size is not fixed -- 

	int a[]=new int[5]; // {0,0,0,0,0}
	a[0]=4; a[1]=5;a[2]=6;
	
		[4,5,6,0,0]  // 8 in the 2nd index

		a[2]=8; // before this 6 has to be shifted to right

	Create an ArrayList of Book in a class BookStore.
	add methods to add a book, remove a book based on isbn, search book based on isbn;
